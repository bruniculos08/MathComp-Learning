  ** Exercise 2
*)

(**
   Show that injectivity is decidable for a function [f : aT -> rT]
   when [aT] is a finite type.

   As a first step, we exhibit a boolean formulation of injectivity:
   a boolean formula, based on boolean "forall", "exists", and "==>" and
   boolean equality, which expresses the property of injectivity.

   We then show that this boolean formula is equivalent to th existing notion
   of [injective], which is not injective in general.
